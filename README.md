# Comparison of two different determinant computing algorithms
## Gauss - Jordan Elimination
* This algorithm is based on the elimination method in which you bring the matrix into row echelon form and then compute the determinant by multiplying the principal diagonal.
## Naive Recursive Approach
* This algorithm is based on the recursive property of determinants.

## N x N Matrix determinant calculator

## Small scale sample array of randomized matrices
* The graph shows how efficient the Gauss - Jordan method is in comparison to the naive approach as the size of the matrix increases.
